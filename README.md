## This is the readme file that contains the guidelines and information about the compilation of the code of the following paper

**Paper Name:-** [Amalgamation of protein sequence, structure and textual information for improving protein-protein interaction identification](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.570.pdf)

- **Authors:** Pratik Dutta and Sriparna Saha
- **Affiliation:** Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India
- **Accepted:(03/04/2020)** [Annual Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics(ACL 2020)](https://acl2020.org/)


This repository contains the exemplified multi-modal datasets and the codes/instrauctions for generating the multi-modal dataset. In this  work, we have proposed protein-protein interaction modeling based on text in conjunction with **protein structure** and **genomic sequence information**, outperforming previous models only based on text. For each modality(`protein structure`, `protein genomic sequence` and `biomedical corpus`), we have developed three diffrent deep learning models. Finally, the extracted features are integrated in **self-attention** mechanism to perform the final prediction of protein interactions.
